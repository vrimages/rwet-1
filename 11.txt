You're setting boundaries, and creating space for other opportunities. This may or may not come across as intimidating to your romantic interest and/or significant other, but to be honest, that is the least of your worries. (No offense to your boo thang, of course.) Single, crushing, or already romantically attached, you're going to need all the space you can get at this time, especially while the moon squares off with your modern ruler, Uranus, via your emotionally driven fourth house of home, family matters, and innermost feelings. Thereâ€™s no escaping the chaos, but this is your niche.
