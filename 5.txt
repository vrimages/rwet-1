Your day-to-day routines seem to be going well, especially with so many planets conjugating in structured Capricorn via your responsible sixth house of health, daily rituals, and due diligence, but what about your love life? The moon will shift into freedom-loving Aquarius, activating your committed seventh house of agreements, compromise, and significant others, which means there will be greater emphasis on you and your special someone's solo projects at this time. There's nothing wrong with taking a little space from each other every now and then. Moreover, the moon's square to change-maker Uranus brings forth significant insight, so make sure to follow your intuition.
