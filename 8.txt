Your traditional ruler, Mars, joins coquettish Venus in Capricorn today via your curious third house of communication, thought process, and immediate surroundings, bringing passion and zest to your exchanges. Although, when in the sign of Capricorn, these romantic and/or financial opportunities are more than likely for the long run. You're not about to settle for anything less than the real deal, and you shouldn't. Moreover, the moon's transit through spontaneous Aquarius and your fourth house of home, family matters, and emotional foundations brings greater emphasis to your innermost feelings as well as your desire for freedom in your personal life. What's next?
