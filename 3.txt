Wondering whether or not you should take a leap of faith in your love life? Luna  — celestial ruler of your second house of comfort, finances, and value systems — will shift into freedom-loving Aquarius and your risk-taking ninth house of adventure, wisdom, and unknown territory today, which, in turn, catapults you into a brand new dimension, but only if you're open to it, of course. Keep in mind that the moon will sextile the wounded healer, Chiron — via your eleventh house of associations, community, and sense of belonging in the world — simultaneously encouraging you to lean on your soul family and network of peers.
