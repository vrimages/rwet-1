With Mars and Venus sizzling through your socially conscious eleventh house of friendship and community, there's no denying your passion and desire for human interaction. Still, feel free to take some well-deserved timeout moments for yourself, as the moon will shift into your unconscious twelfth house of closure, dreams, inhibitions, and all things behind the scenes. Sounds like an oxymoron when you're in the mood to socialize, but your contradicting nature is part of your charm. And given that the moon governs your fifth house of romance, you may opt for a cozy corner booth at the local bar where you can people-watch and snuggle up to a lover.
