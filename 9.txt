The truth isn't always pretty, and you know this better than anyone. For instance, the moon's shift into spontaneous Aquarius via your curious third house of communication, thought process, and immediate surroundings will bring emotional emphasis to themes surrounding your local community and personal exchanges.

With Luna sitting in a square to the wounded healer, Chiron, this could be what triggers a conversation that's equally as uncomfortable as it is overdue.
