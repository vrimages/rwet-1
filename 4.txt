Feisty Mars continues to sizzle through your harmony-seeking seventh house of agreements, compromise, and significant others, bringing energy and passion to your relationship sector. Got your eye on someone? Given that the moon will be glimmering through freedom-loving Aquarius via your eighth house of sex, intimate unions, and energetic exchanges, you're more than likely craving mental stimulation and experimentation in your love life. Sitting in a healing sextile to the wounded healer, Chiron via your tenth house of authority, Luna is encouraging you to take control of your personal life and perhaps even transform your reputation if needed.
